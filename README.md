CSS Package for Python Computational Social Science
---------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

This is the readme file for the python css package,
developed by Edward Hunter for testing and evaluating machine
learning algorithms for Computational Social Science applications
in research and coursework. It was first used as courseware
in UCSD's Soc-211 "Introduction to Computational
Methods in Social Science," in Spring 2014. Algorithms are based
on scikit-learn and some original implementations. See below for
instructions on installing dependencies on various operating systems.

Installing Dependencies and Setup
---------------------------------

**Dependencies**

The following software is required or advised for use of this package:

Required:

1. Python: Version 2.7.6 is used and tested.
2. numpy: Numerical Python library. Has additional dependencies.
3. scipy: Scientific Python library extending numpy. Has additional
dependencies.
4. scikit-learn: Python machine learning library.
5. matplotlib: Graphics and visualization Python library. Has additional
dependencies.
6. nltk: Python natural language processing library.
7. BeautifulSoup4: High level Python HTML parsing library.

Highly Recommended:

1. A decent source code editor. Edward recommends PyCharm.
2. git: Distributed source code control for access to this repository.
3. easy_install/setuptools: Python package installer. Part of the
setuptools 3rd party module that extends Python's native distutils module.
4. pip: Better package installer improving on easy_install.
5. virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper: Support for Python virtual environments.

We will proceed with install instructions assuming all of these packages
are available.

**Installation on Windows**

Setting up git

a) Installing github on Windows

1)  Go to the following link: https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.9.0-preview20140217.exe&can=2&q=
2)  Click on download GitHub for Windows
3)  Double click on the installer and follow the instructions

b)Setting the lab directory

1) Open command prompt(start-> in the search bar type cmd and hit enter)
2) Navigate to the directory where you want to download all the files
3) Type the following command in your command prompt "git clone https://github.com/edwardhunter/soc290.git"
4) if you the following message "Checking connectivity... done." they you have downloaded all the required files

Install python and required dependencies

1) Go to the following link : https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads
2) Download the recent version of python executable "Python(x,y)-2.7.6.0.exe"
3) Click the installer and follow the instructions
4) Make sure you have all the required packages installed typing following command "pip freeze",
 you might see other packages as well but make sure you have following packages installed:
PyYAML==3.10
beautifulsoup4==4.3.2
matplotlib==1.1.1
nltk==2.0.4
numpy==1.8.0
scikit-learn==0.14.1
scipy==0.13.2


Installing python Editor

There are lots of options for python editors, and here is one of each editor

Pycharm (Gui editor)

1) Go to the following link http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ and download the free Community Edition
2) Click on the installer and follow the instructions
3) Once Pycharm has been installed , you can open it and create a new project
4) Point it to the location where you have downloaded all the code git
5) Sometimes Pycharm  fails to locate the python interpreter that we have installed , Just point it to the right location.
Usually python interpreter will installed at "c:\Python27\"
