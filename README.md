CSS Package for Python Computational Social Science
===================================================

**Introduction**

This is the readme file for the python css package,
developed by Edward Hunter for testing and evaluating machine
learning algorithms for Computational Social Science applications
in research and coursework. It was first used as courseware
in UCSD's Soc-211 "Introduction to Computational
Methods in Social Science," in Spring 2014. Algorithms are based
on scikit-learn and original implementations. See below for
instructions on installing dependencies on various operating systems.

Installing Dependencies and Setup
---------------------------------

**Dependencies**

The following software is required or advised for use of this package:

1. Python: Version 2.7.6 is used and tested.
2. A decent source code editor. Edward recommends PyCharm.
3. git: Distributed source code control for access to this repository.
4. easy_install/setuptools: Python package installer. Part of the
setuptools 3rd party module that extends Python's native distutils module.
5. pip: Better package installer improving on easy_install.
6. virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper: Support for Python virtual environments.
7. numpy: Numerical Python library. Has additional dependencies.
